# Design Principles

> This document defines the architectural principles that guide the design and development of TidyMind. These principles should be considered when making architectural decisions, implementing new features, or extending the system.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these design principles is to ensure that TidyMind remains consistent, maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand as the project evolves.

Every subsystem should be designed with these principles in mind.

---

# 1. Modular Architecture

TidyMind is designed as a collection of independent subsystems.

Each subsystem should have a clearly defined responsibility and expose well-defined interfaces for interacting with other parts of the application.

A subsystem should be replaceable or extendable without requiring significant changes elsewhere in the application.

---

# 2. Separation of Concerns

Each component should focus on a single responsibility.

For example:

* The Scanner discovers files.
* Readers extract content.
* The AI subsystem interprets information.
* The Database stores information.
* The GUI presents information.

Business logic should remain independent from presentation logic.

---

# 3. Loose Coupling

Subsystems should minimize direct dependencies on one another.

Communication between components should occur through shared interfaces, services, or events rather than direct implementation knowledge.

This improves maintainability and makes components easier to test and replace.

---

# 4. High Cohesion

Components should group together functionality that naturally belongs together.

A component should perform one well-defined task rather than accumulating unrelated responsibilities.

This improves readability, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

---

# 5. Local-First Design

Core functionality should operate without requiring internet connectivity.

Artificial Intelligence, indexing, searching, and file management should function locally whenever possible.

Optional cloud services may be supported but should never replace the local experience.

---

# 6. Privacy by Design

User privacy is a fundamental architectural requirement.

The system should minimize unnecessary data collection and process user files locally whenever possible.

Any communication with external services should be transparent and require explicit user consent.

---

# 7. Transparency

The system should make its actions understandable.

Whenever practical, users should be able to understand:

* Why a recommendation was made.
* Why a file was classified in a particular way.
* Why an automation rule was triggered.
* Why a file was moved or renamed.

Artificial Intelligence should provide assistance that is explainable rather than opaque.

---

# 8. User Control

Automation should always remain under the user's control.

Users should have the ability to:

* Review recommendations.
* Configure automation.
* Override AI decisions.
* Undo supported operations.
* Disable optional functionality.

The application should assist rather than dictate.

---

# 9. Extensibility

The architecture should be designed to support future growth.

New functionality should be added by extending existing interfaces rather than modifying unrelated components.

Examples include:

* Additional file readers.
* New AI providers.
* Search providers.
* Plugins.
* Reporting modules.

---

# 10. Scalability

The architecture should support both small personal collections and large datasets.

Long-running operations should be designed to scale efficiently while keeping the user interface responsive.

---

# 11. Maintainability

Code should be organized into logical modules with clear boundaries.

Complexity should be reduced through:

* Clear interfaces.
* Consistent naming.
* Reusable components.
* Comprehensive documentation.

A contributor should be able to understand an individual subsystem without needing to understand the entire application.

---

# 12. Cross-Platform Compatibility

The architecture should remain independent of operating system specifics whenever practical.

Platform-specific functionality should be isolated behind dedicated abstractions to simplify maintenance and improve portability.

---

# 13. Security

The architecture should prioritize safe operation.

The application should:

* Validate user input.
* Handle errors gracefully.
* Avoid destructive operations without confirmation.
* Protect application data.
* Prevent unauthorized plugin behavior where possible.

Security should be considered throughout the design process rather than added afterwards.

---

# Applying These Principles

These principles should be considered whenever:

* Designing a new subsystem.
* Adding new features.
* Refactoring existing code.
* Reviewing pull requests.
* Evaluating community contributions.

Architectural decisions should favor long-term maintainability and consistency over short-term convenience.
