# Readers Overview

> This document distinguishes the bounded 1.0 content pipeline from richer future readers.

---

## Implementation Status

OpenSorSe 1.0 implements `IMetadataExtractor` and `IMetadataExtractionPipeline` for filesystem metadata, defensive PDF fields/native text, bounded DOCX/XLSX core properties/native text, and PNG/JPEG dimensions. It also provides separately enabled OCR Beta through a capability-detected local Tesseract CLI for PNG/JPEG/TIFF. Extractors are read-only, bounded, cancellable, never execute macros, and never fetch remote resources.

Scanned-PDF OCR, rich document layout, media/archive readers, formula evaluation, embedded-object execution, and full-fidelity content parsing remain future work. Format-specific documents in this directory are authoritative only where the v1.0 implementation/specification explicitly says a capability is delivered.

---

## Purpose

The Readers/content boundary provides consistent defensive extraction while keeping format handling separate from scanning, rules, semantic indexing, and presentation.

---

## Prospective Responsibilities

The implemented narrow subsystem is responsible for:

* Selecting a reader for a supported file type.
* Extracting content and format-specific metadata without modifying the source file.
* Isolating failures to the affected file.
* Reporting extraction outcomes through the application's diagnostics model.

It would not own filesystem traversal, result presentation, persistence, AI inference, or file-changing operations.

---

## Relationship to the Current Release

The Scanner remains responsible for recursive traversal, basic metadata, hashing, errors, progress, and cancellation. After scan enrichment, the optional application content stage caches supported extracted metadata/text by source fingerprint and isolates every per-file failure.
