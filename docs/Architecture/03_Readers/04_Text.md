# Text Reader

> This document defines the Text Reader component, which is responsible for extracting textual content and metadata from plain text-based file formats.

---

## Purpose

The Text Reader extracts textual information from supported text-based file formats and converts it into a normalized representation for downstream processing.

Its primary responsibility is to read textual content accurately while preserving document structure where practical.

The Text Reader does not interpret the meaning of the extracted text.

---

# Responsibilities

The Text Reader is responsible for:

* Reading supported text-based files.
* Detecting text encoding where practical.
* Extracting textual content.
* Preserving document structure where appropriate.
* Extracting basic document metadata.
* Forwarding extracted information for further processing.

---

# Scope

### In Scope

* Plain text
* Markdown
* CSV
* JSON
* XML
* YAML
* INI
* Log files
* Source code files
* Configuration files

### Out of Scope

The Text Reader is **not** responsible for:

* Syntax analysis
* Source code understanding
* AI analysis
* Search indexing
* Document classification
* File modification

These responsibilities belong to downstream subsystems.

# Architectural Overview

The Text Reader extracts structured textual information before forwarding the resulting document representation for further processing.

# Processing Workflow

A typical text processing operation consists of the following stages:

1. Receive a file descriptor.
2. Verify that the file is a supported text format.
3. Detect the file encoding where necessary.
4. Read the document contents.
5. Preserve structural information where practical.
6. Produce a normalized document representation.
7. Forward the document for further processing.

---

# Supported Formats

The architecture should support common text-based formats, including:

* TXT
* MD
* CSV
* JSON
* XML
* YAML / YML
* INI
* LOG
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Python
* C / C++
* Java
* C#
* Go
* Rust
* PHP
* SQL

Additional text-based formats may be supported as the application evolves.

# Extracted Information

The Text Reader may extract information including:

| Information     | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Encoding   | Character encoding where available.                            |
| Line Count      | Total number of lines.                                         |
| Character Count | Total number of characters.                                    |
| Word Count      | Total number of words where applicable.                        |
| Text Content    | Complete textual content.                                      |
| File Structure  | Basic structural information such as line breaks and sections. |

The exact information extracted depends on the file format.

# Design Principles

The Text Reader should remain:

* Read-only.
* Deterministic.
* Format-independent.
* Efficient.
* Independent of AI.
* Independent of programming language semantics.

Its responsibility is limited to extracting textual information.

---

# Error Handling

The Text Reader should handle common failures gracefully.

Examples include:

* Unsupported encodings.
* Corrupted text files.
* Invalid character sequences.
* Extremely large files.
* Read failures.

Whenever practical, partially readable content should still be extracted.

---

# Future Considerations

The architecture should support future enhancements, including:

* Automatic encoding detection.
* Streaming support for very large files.
* Language identification.
* Structured document segmentation.
* Plugin-defined text readers.

These enhancements should improve extraction capabilities while preserving the component's primary responsibility.
