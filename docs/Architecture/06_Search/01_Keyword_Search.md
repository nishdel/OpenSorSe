# Keyword Search

> This document defines the Keyword Search component, which is responsible for retrieving documents through exact and partial text matching across indexed application data.

---

## Purpose

The Keyword Search component enables users to locate documents by searching for specific words, phrases, or patterns.

It provides fast, deterministic retrieval based on indexed textual information stored within the TidyMind database.

Keyword Search complements semantic search by providing precise matching against document content and metadata.

---

# Responsibilities

The Keyword Search component is responsible for:

* Searching indexed document text.
* Searching metadata.
* Matching filenames.
* Matching document properties.
* Returning keyword-based search results.
* Supporting structured search queries.

---

# Scope

### In Scope

* Exact word matching
* Partial word matching
* Phrase searching
* Filename searching
* Metadata searching
* Full-text searching

### Out of Scope

The Keyword Search component is **not** responsible for:

* Semantic understanding
* Embedding generation
* AI inference
* Search ranking
* Result filtering
* Database indexing

These responsibilities belong to other architectural components.

# Architectural Overview

The Keyword Search component retrieves matching documents using indexed textual information.

UserQuery["User Query"]

KeywordSearch["Keyword Search"]

SearchIndex["Search Index"]

CandidateResults["Candidate Results"]

UserQuery --> KeywordSearch

KeywordSearch --> SearchIndex

SearchIndex --> CandidateResults
```

The Keyword Search component returns candidate results that may later be filtered and ranked.

# Search Workflow

A typical keyword search consists of the following stages:

1. Receive a user query.
2. Parse the search terms.
3. Search indexed content.
4. Identify matching documents.
5. Return candidate results.
6. Forward the results for filtering and ranking.

Keyword Search should remain deterministic and repeatable for identical queries.

---

# Search Sources

Keyword Search may operate on information including:

* Filenames.
* File paths.
* Extracted document text.
* Metadata.
* AI-generated summaries.
* AI-generated tags.
* User-defined tags.

Additional searchable sources may be introduced as the application evolves.

---

# Query Features

The architecture should support common keyword search capabilities, including:

* Single-word searches.
* Phrase searches.
* Partial matches.
* Prefix matching.
* Exact matching.
* Case-insensitive searching.

Advanced query capabilities may be introduced in future versions.

---

# Design Principles

The Keyword Search component should remain:

* Deterministic.
* Fast.
* Reliable.
* Extensible.
* Independent of semantic search.

Keyword Search should retrieve documents based on textual matches rather than inferred meaning.

---

# Error Handling

Keyword search failures should be handled gracefully.

Examples include:

* Invalid search queries.
* Missing search indexes.
* Corrupted indexes.
* Empty queries.
* Unsupported query syntax.

Whenever practical, partial search functionality should remain available.

---

# Future Considerations

The architecture should support future enhancements, including:

* Boolean search operators.
* Regular expression support.
* Fuzzy matching.
* Wildcard searches.
* Advanced query syntax.
* Plugin-defined search providers.

These enhancements should preserve the component's primary responsibility of deterministic text retrieval.
