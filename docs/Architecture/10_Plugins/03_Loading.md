# Loading

> This document defines the Loading component, which is responsible for validating, loading, and initializing plugins for use within TidyMind.

---

## Purpose

The Loading component prepares discovered plugins for execution within the application.

Its primary purpose is to validate plugin compatibility, load plugin implementations, initialize supported extension points, and register plugins with the core application.

The Loading component initializes plugins but does not manage their ongoing lifecycle.

---

# Responsibilities

The Loading component is responsible for:

* Validating plugin compatibility.
* Loading plugin assemblies or packages.
* Initializing plugin instances.
* Registering extension points.
* Reporting loading status.
* Preparing plugins for execution.

---

# Scope

### In Scope

* Plugin loading
* Compatibility validation
* Plugin initialization
* Extension registration
* Loading status
* Plugin activation

### Out of Scope

The Loading component is **not** responsible for:

* Plugin discovery
* Plugin lifecycle management
* Plugin security policy
* Business logic
* User interface rendering

These responsibilities belong to other architectural components.

---

# Architectural Overview

The Loading component transforms discovered plugins into initialized application extensions.

Discovery --> Loading

Loading --> PluginAPI

PluginAPI --> InitializedPlugins
```

The Loading component ensures that only compatible plugins become active within the application.

---

# Loading Workflow

A typical loading process consists of the following stages:

1. Receive discovered plugin metadata.
2. Validate Plugin API compatibility.
3. Resolve required dependencies.
4. Load the plugin package.
5. Initialize the plugin.
6. Register supported extension points.
7. Report loading success or failure.

Only successfully initialized plugins should become available to the application.

# Validation Criteria

The architecture should validate information including:

| Validation            | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Plugin Identifier     | Verify uniqueness.                        |
| Plugin Version        | Verify compatibility.                     |
| API Version           | Verify supported Plugin API version.      |
| Required Dependencies | Verify required components are available. |
| Manifest              | Verify plugin metadata completeness.      |

Additional validation rules may be introduced as the plugin system evolves.

# Loading Principles

Plugin loading should be:

* Predictable.
* Safe.
* Isolated.
* Repeatable.
* Transparent.

Loading failures should affect only the relevant plugin whenever practical.

---

# Design Principles

The Loading component should remain:

* Independent of plugin discovery.
* Independent of lifecycle management.
* Extensible.
* Secure.
* Focused on initialization.

Its responsibility is limited to preparing compatible plugins for use.

---

# Error Handling

Plugin loading failures should be handled gracefully.

Examples include:

* Incompatible Plugin API versions.
* Missing dependencies.
* Invalid plugin packages.
* Initialization failures.
* Duplicate plugin identifiers.

Whenever practical, failed plugins should be disabled while allowing compatible plugins to continue loading.

---

# Future Considerations

The architecture should support future enhancements, including:

* Lazy plugin loading.
* Parallel plugin loading.
* Optional dependency resolution.
* Hot-loading plugins.
* Plugin sandbox preparation.
* Plugin performance diagnostics.

These enhancements should preserve the Loading component's primary responsibility of initializing plugins.
