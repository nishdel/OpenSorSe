# Lifecycle

> This document defines the Lifecycle component, which is responsible for managing the operational state of plugins throughout their lifetime within TidyMind.

---

## Purpose

The Lifecycle component manages plugins after they have been successfully initialized.

Its primary purpose is to control plugin startup, activation, deactivation, shutdown, and cleanup while ensuring that plugins integrate safely and predictably with the application.

The Lifecycle component manages plugin state but does not perform plugin discovery or loading.

---

# Responsibilities

The Lifecycle component is responsible for:

* Managing plugin startup.
* Activating plugins.
* Deactivating plugins.
* Managing shutdown.
* Releasing plugin resources.
* Tracking plugin state.

---

# Scope

### In Scope

* Plugin activation
* Plugin deactivation
* Startup
* Shutdown
* State management
* Resource cleanup

### Out of Scope

The Lifecycle component is **not** responsible for:

* Plugin discovery
* Plugin loading
* Security validation
* Business logic
* User interface rendering
* Plugin implementation

These responsibilities belong to other architectural components.

# Architectural Overview

The Lifecycle component manages the operational state of initialized plugins.

The Lifecycle component coordinates plugin operation throughout the application's lifetime.

# Lifecycle Workflow

A typical plugin lifecycle consists of the following stages:

1. Receive an initialized plugin.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Monitor operational state.
4. Deactivate the plugin when requested.
5. Release resources.
6. Complete shutdown.

Lifecycle management should remain predictable and repeatable.

# Plugin States

The architecture should support operational states including:

| State      | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Discovered | Plugin identified but not loaded.          |
| Loaded     | Plugin initialized and ready.              |
| Active     | Plugin currently available for use.        |
| Disabled   | Plugin intentionally disabled.             |
| Failed     | Plugin encountered an unrecoverable error. |
| Unloaded   | Plugin no longer active.                   |

Additional lifecycle states may be introduced as the plugin system evolves.

# Lifecycle Principles

Plugin lifecycle management should be:

* Predictable.
* Safe.
* Observable.
* Isolated.
* Recoverable where practical.

Plugins should transition cleanly between lifecycle states.

---

# Design Principles

The Lifecycle component should remain:

* Independent of loading.
* Independent of plugin implementation.
* Extensible.
* Reliable.
* Focused on state management.

Its responsibility is limited to managing plugin operational state.

---

# Error Handling

Lifecycle failures should be isolated to the affected plugin whenever practical.

Examples include:

* Activation failures.
* Shutdown failures.
* Resource cleanup failures.
* Unexpected runtime errors.
* State transition failures.

Whenever practical, plugin failures should not affect unrelated plugins or the core application.

---

# Future Considerations

The architecture should support future enhancements, including:

* Plugin hot reload.
* Plugin suspension.
* Plugin restart.
* Dependency-aware lifecycle management.
* Plugin health monitoring.
* Automatic recovery strategies.

These enhancements should preserve the Lifecycle component's primary responsibility of managing plugin state.
