# Coding Standards

> This document defines the coding standards and development practices used throughout the TidyMind project.

---

# Purpose

The Coding Standards document establishes consistent development practices across the TidyMind codebase.

Its purpose is to improve readability, maintainability, collaboration, and long-term project quality by encouraging a consistent coding style and development approach.

These standards apply to all core components, plugins maintained within the project, and future contributions unless explicitly documented otherwise.

---

# General Principles

The codebase should strive to be:

* Readable.
* Consistent.
* Maintainable.
* Testable.
* Predictable.

Code should prioritize clarity over unnecessary complexity.

---

# Design Principles

Developers should favor:

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
* Dependency Injection.
* Composition over inheritance.
* Interface-based design.
* Immutable data where practical.
* Small, focused classes.

Architectural consistency should take precedence over individual coding preferences.

---

# Code Organization

Source code should be organized according to the project's architectural structure.

General guidelines include:

* One primary class per file.
* Related functionality grouped into appropriate namespaces.
* Clear separation between interfaces and implementations.
* Avoid circular dependencies between modules.

Project organization should reflect the documented architecture.

---

# Naming

Developers should follow the project's documented naming conventions.

Names should be:

* Descriptive.
* Consistent.
* Domain-oriented.
* Easy to understand.

Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely recognized.

---

# Documentation

Public interfaces should be documented where appropriate.

Documentation should explain:

* Purpose.
* Responsibilities.
* Parameters.
* Return values.
* Important behavior.

Comments should explain *why*, not simply restate *what* the code already expresses.

---

# Error Handling

Error handling should be:

* Explicit.
* Predictable.
* Informative.
* Consistent.

Exceptions should communicate meaningful information while avoiding unnecessary exposure of internal implementation details.

---

# Testing

The project should encourage:

* Unit tests.
* Integration tests.
* Repeatable test execution.
* Automated testing where practical.

Code should be designed with testability in mind.

---

# Performance

Developers should:

* Avoid premature optimization.
* Measure performance before optimizing.
* Prefer clear code over micro-optimizations.
* Optimize only where justified by evidence.

Performance improvements should not compromise maintainability without clear benefit.

---

# Dependencies

External dependencies should be introduced carefully.

Before adding a dependency, contributors should consider:

* Long-term maintenance.
* License compatibility.
* Security implications.
* Community adoption.
* Project size.

Whenever practical, unnecessary dependencies should be avoided.

---

# Pull Requests

Contributors are encouraged to:

* Keep pull requests focused.
* Explain the motivation for changes.
* Update documentation where necessary.
* Include tests when appropriate.
* Follow project architecture.

Smaller, well-scoped pull requests are preferred over large unrelated changes.

---

# Code Reviews

Code reviews should focus on:

* Correctness.
* Readability.
* Maintainability.
* Architectural consistency.
* Long-term project health.

Reviews should remain constructive and respectful.

---

# Future Considerations

As the project evolves, this document may expand to include:

* Language-specific conventions.
* Formatting standards.
* Static analysis requirements.
* CI/CD quality gates.
* Security review guidelines.

The primary objective should remain consistent, maintainable software development practices.
