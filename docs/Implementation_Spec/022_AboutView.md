# Purpose

The About View displays information about OpenSorSe, including the application version, licensing, authorship, acknowledgements, and useful project links.

---

# Why

Users should be able to easily identify the version of OpenSorSe they are using, understand its licensing, and find official project resources.

For an open-source project, this view also provides a clear entry point for contributors.

# Autonomous v0.1 Decisions

The draft does not define a metadata provider, version source, repository URI, documentation URI, or link-launching contract. v0.1 declares application version `0.1.0` in the Desktop project and presents static matching metadata. Repository and documentation links are represented as vetted HTTPS `Uri` values and emitted as external-link requests; the view never launches a process or requires internet access.

The implementation specification declares the MIT license, which is displayed as supplied. A packaged license file, contributor list, changelog, release notes, link-opening host policy, and actual network access remain deferred.
