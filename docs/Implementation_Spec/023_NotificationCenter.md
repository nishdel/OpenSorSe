# Implementation Specification

| Property | Value |

| Spec ID | 023 |
| Component | Notification Center |
| Project | OpenSorSe.UI |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Target Release | v0.1 |
| Status | Draft |

# Purpose

The Notification Center displays informational messages, warnings, errors, and successful operations to the user.

It provides consistent feedback throughout the application without interrupting the user's workflow.

---

# Why

Users should always receive clear feedback about what OpenSorSe is doing.

A centralized notification system provides a consistent user experience and avoids duplicate notification logic across the application.

---

# Responsibilities

The Notification Center shall:

- Display information messages.
- Display success messages.
- Display warning messages.
- Display error messages.
- Queue multiple notifications.
- Automatically dismiss temporary notifications.
- Allow manual dismissal.

---

# Does NOT

The Notification Center must NOT:

- Execute business logic.
- Scan folders.
- Move files.
- Execute rules.
- Modify the filesystem.
- Decide when notifications should be generated.

---

# Inputs

- Notification requests.
- User interaction.

---

# Outputs

The component provides:

- User feedback.
- Notification status.

---

# Workflow

1. Receive a notification request.
2. Determine the notification type.
3. Display the notification.
4. Wait for timeout or user dismissal.
5. Remove the notification.

---

# Assumptions

- The application is running.
- Notification requests originate from other components.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

The implementation is complete when:

- Information notifications display correctly.
- Success notifications display correctly.
- Warning notifications display correctly.
- Error notifications display correctly.
- Multiple notifications are handled correctly.
- UI tests pass.

# Autonomous v0.1 Decisions

The draft does not define notification models, queue bounds, timeouts, event contracts, or a notification source. v0.1 provides a local in-memory presentation queue with immutable requests/messages, sequential process-local identifiers, manual dismissal, and automatic expiry. Information and success notifications default to five seconds; warnings and errors require manual dismissal to avoid concealing actionable feedback.

The component accepts explicit UI requests only and does not subscribe to the Event Bus or error handler before their later contracts are finalized. It uses a captured UI synchronization context for timer-driven expiry. History, actions, desktop notifications, progress notifications, event subscriptions, persistence, and cross-process delivery remain deferred.
