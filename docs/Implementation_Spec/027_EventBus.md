# Autonomous v0.1 Decisions

The Phase 2 Core foundation already provides `IEventBus` and `EventBus`; no duplicate implementation is introduced. v0.1 event delivery is in-memory, type-specific, sequential over a subscription snapshot, cancellation-aware between handlers, and subscription-lifetime controlled by the returned `IDisposable`. Subscriber failures are isolated and logged so other handlers can continue.

Events are not persisted, retried, replayed, ordered across event types, dispatched remotely, or used as a replacement for direct request/response dependencies.
