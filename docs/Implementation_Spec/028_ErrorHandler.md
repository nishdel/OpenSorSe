# Autonomous v0.1 Decisions

The Phase 2 Core foundation already provides `IErrorHandler`, `ApplicationError`, severity classification, and `ErrorHandler`; no replacement is introduced. v0.1 callers report user-safe `ApplicationError` values with optional diagnostic exceptions. The handler maps declared severities to centralized logging and raises `ErrorReported` for UI adapters without directly depending on notification UI.

The error handler does not retry, decide business recovery, suppress caller exceptions, persist diagnostic history, expose raw exception data to users, or invoke destructive operations. Notification-center adaptation remains a later application-controller concern.
