# Remote Implementation Progress

This report records remote static implementation work only. It does not redefine any implementation contract and does not indicate successful compilation or test execution.

## Specification 004 — File Classifier

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: `FileClassifier`, `IFileClassifier`, classification models, and classifier tests in the Scanner project.
- Files modified: `FileEntry`, desktop composition root, and `004_FileClassifier.md`.
- Public APIs: `IFileClassifier`, `FileClassifier`, classification rules, options, result, statistics, issues, and categories.
- Tests: deterministic classification, rule-validation, immutability, ordering, and cancellation coverage.
- Assumption: this is the deterministic metadata classifier, not the future semantic AI classifier.
- Static-review concerns: local compilation and xUnit discovery remain required.
- Expected test-count increase: unverified; classifier test cases include theory data rows.

## Specification 005 — Duplicate Detector

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: `DuplicateDetector`, `IDuplicateDetector`, duplicate models, and duplicate-detector tests.
- Files modified: `FileEntry`, desktop composition root, and `005_DuplicateDetector.md`.
- Public APIs: `IDuplicateDetector`, `DuplicateDetector`, duplicate status/classification/group/result/statistics/issues.
- Tests: SHA-256 normalization, grouping, ordering, invalid hashes, immutability, statistics, and cancellation.
- Assumptions: only supplied SHA-256 hashes are evaluated; no file access occurs.
- Static-review concerns: local compilation and test discovery remain required.
- Expected test-count increase: 16 duplicate-detector theory/fact cases, unverified.

## Specification 006 — Rule Engine

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: `TidyMind.Rules` and `TidyMind.Rules.Tests` projects, pure rule engine, rule models, and tests.
- Files modified: solution, desktop project/reference and composition root, and `006_RuleEngine.md`.
- Public APIs: `IRuleEngine`, `RuleEngine`, actions, conditions, rules, decisions, result, and statistics.
- Tests: matching, priority/ties, validation, missing enriched data, input preservation, statistics, and cancellation.
- Assumption: Specification 006 is a pure evaluator; broader Rules orchestration is deferred.
- Static-review concerns: local compilation, solution wiring, and test discovery remain required.
- Expected test-count increase: unverified; includes theory data rows.

## Specification 007 — Move Planner

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: action planner, planner models, planner interface, and action-planner tests in the Rules projects.
- Files modified: desktop composition root and `007_MovePlanner.md`.
- Public APIs: `IActionPlanner`, `ActionPlanner`, planned-operation, planning issue, result, and statistics models.
- Tests: supported operations, lexical paths/templates, recoverable issues, ordering, immutability, statistics, and cancellation.
- Assumption: planning is lexical only; no filesystem inspection or live-conflict resolution occurs.
- Static-review concerns: platform-specific path semantics and local compilation/test discovery remain required.
- Expected test-count increase: unverified; includes theory data rows.

## Specification 008 — Conflict Resolver

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: conflict resolver, public API, conflict models, and conflict-resolver tests in the Rules projects.
- Files modified: desktop composition root and `008_ConflictResolver.md`.
- Public APIs: `IConflictResolver`, `ConflictResolver`, options, strategy, result, statistics, and issue models.
- Tests: deterministic keep-first behavior, IDs, signatures, destinations, sources, validation, immutability, statistics, and cancellation.
- Assumption: only intra-plan lexical conflicts are resolved; live filesystem conflicts remain deferred.
- Static-review concerns: platform path behavior, local compilation, and test discovery remain required.
- Expected test-count increase: unverified; includes theory/fact cases.

## Specification 009 — Move Executor

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: Executor project, Executor test project, executor models, API, implementation, and initial deterministic tests.
- Files modified: solution, desktop project/composition root, and `009_MoveExecutor.md`.
- Public APIs: `IActionExecutor`, `ActionExecutor`, execution outcomes/issues/progress/statistics/results, and undo records.
- Tests: empty/cancelled input, collection validation, supported operations, no-overwrite behavior, source and metadata validation, undo records, copied bytes, recoverable continuation, deterministic active-copy cancellation/cleanup, progress, and capability-gated reparse-point rejection.
- Assumption: Delete remains intentionally unsupported and is skipped; only Move, Copy, and Rename execute.
- Static-review concerns: local compilation and platform-specific filesystem behavior require host verification.
- Expected test-count increase: 11 fact tests, unverified.

## Specification 010 — Undo Engine

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: Undo Engine, undo result/progress/statistics models, and Undo Engine tests in the Executor projects.
- Files modified: desktop composition root and `010_UndoEngine.md`.
- Public APIs: `IUndoEngine`, `UndoEngine`, undo outcomes, issues, statistics, results, and progress models.
- Tests: basic validation, cancellation, supported undo kinds, overwrite safety, missing-result, and directory-result checks.
- Assumption: Copy undo is explicit-path best effort; history persistence is deferred.
- Static-review concerns: complete link, progress, cancellation-between-records, and DI coverage still needs host confirmation.
- Expected test-count increase: 4 fact tests, unverified.

## Specification 011 — Logging Service

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: local logging options, process-lifetime statistics, local file logger provider, logging tests, and autonomous decision log.
- Files modified: logging service/interface, application settings/configuration loading, application lifecycle mapping, and `011_LoggingService.md`.
- Public APIs: `LoggingOptions`, `LoggingStatistics`, compatible `ILoggingService.Initialize(LoggingOptions)`, and `GetStatistics()`.
- Tests: local daily text output, severity filtering, sink disablement/failure isolation, retention, privacy, validation, disposal, configuration preservation, and DI resolution.
- Autonomous decision: use local UTF-8 daily files with seven-file retention and Debug fallback; no entry-query API or remote output.
- Static-review corrections: retention is limited to exact daily file names and cannot delete the current UTC log file.
- Expected test-count increase: 8 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 012 — Configuration Manager

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: none; the existing Core configuration foundation was completed in place.
- Files modified: JSON configuration service, configuration validation exception, configuration tests, and `012_ConfigurationManager.md`.
- Public APIs: compatible `IConfigurationService` contract; `ConfigurationValidationException` adds an inner-exception constructor.
- Tests: default loading, precedence, malformed JSON, round-trip persistence, cancellation before filesystem access, and absolute-path validation.
- Autonomous decision: defaults then JSON then logging-level environment override; only the configured application settings file may be atomically replaced.
- Static-review corrections: malformed JSON maps to a configuration-domain exception, and cancellation is checked before filesystem work.
- Expected test-count increase: 4 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specifications 013–023 — Desktop UI Components

- Status: Dependency-blocked.
- Blocked by: their required UI contracts are not detailed sufficiently to define view models, commands, navigation/dialog behavior, state models, and acceptance criteria; several additionally depend on blocked pipeline, planning, execution, logging, configuration, or session contracts.

## Specification 024 — Scan Orchestrator

- Status: Dependency-blocked.
- Blocked by: it explicitly depends on the core pipeline through Specification 008, which is blocked.

## Specification 025 — Session Manager

- Status: Dependency-blocked.
- Blocked by: it depends on Specification 024 and the unresolved logging contract.

## Specification 026 — Application Controller

- Status: Dependency-blocked.
- Blocked by: it depends on Specification 024.

## Specification 027 — Event Bus

- Status: Blocked by missing or conflicting documentation.
- Missing decisions: event typing and envelope contract, subscription lifetime/error behavior, dispatch/cancellation/threading semantics, public API, and testable delivery guarantees. A Phase 2 event-bus foundation already exists and must not be replaced speculatively.

## Specification 028 — Error Handler

- Status: Dependency-blocked.
- Blocked by: it depends on the unresolved logging contract. Its own document also lacks a severity classification, notification, continuation, public API, and testable failure contract. A Phase 2 error-handling foundation already exists.

## Verification

No restore, build, test, formatting, application-launch, Git, GitHub, or runtime verification was performed while the user was away.

## Specification 013 — Main Window (Current Status)

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: `NavigationDestination`, desktop view-model tests, and the Desktop test project.
- Files modified: Main ViewModel, Main Window XAML, solution, and `013_MainWindow.md`.
- Public APIs: `NavigationDestination`, `MainViewModel.Destinations`, `SelectedDestination`, `CurrentPageTitle`, `StatusText`, and `Navigate`.
- Tests: default destination, deterministic navigation, property notification, and unsupported destination rejection.

- Static-review concerns: Avalonia XAML compilation and new test-project discovery require local verification.
- Expected test-count increase: 3 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: not retried after the established NuGet/generated-file environmental blocker.

## Specification 014 â€” Dashboard (Current Status)

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: dashboard view, dashboard view model, and immutable dashboard statistics model.
- Files modified: shell view model, main-window XAML, dashboard documentation, decision log, and desktop view-model tests.

- Verification: not retried after the established NuGet/generated-file environmental blocker.

## Specification 015 â€” Folder Selection

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: folder-selection view, view model, scan-request model, and deterministic view-model tests.
- Files modified: shell view model, main-window XAML, folder-selection specification, decision log, and shell tests.
- Public APIs: `FolderSelectionViewModel`, `ScanRequest`, selected/recent root collections, commands, and scan-request event.
- Tests: normalization, validation, duplicate rejection, remove behavior, selection-order request emission, and empty request handling.
- Autonomous decision: manually entered local roots replace the undocumented picker contract; recent roots are process-lifetime only.
- Expected test-count increase: 6 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 026 â€” Application Controller

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: controller interface and narrow session-routing implementation.
- Files modified: Desktop composition root, controller specification, and decision log.
- Public APIs: `IApplicationController` and `ApplicationController.StartProcessingAsync`.
- Autonomous decision: controller routes only non-destructive processing requests; UI navigation and execution authorization remain outside its contract.
- Tests: completed/cancelled lifecycle, unique ID/explicit close, unexpected failure tracking, and controller request forwarding.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 027 â€” Event Bus

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified (existing Phase 2 implementation reused).
- Files modified: Event Bus specification and decision log only.
- Public APIs: existing `IEventBus`, `EventBus`, and `IApplicationEvent` contracts.
- Tests: existing Core event-bus tests require local verification.

## Specification 028 â€” Error Handler

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified (existing Phase 2 implementation reused).
- Files modified: Error Handler specification and decision log only.
- Public APIs: existing `IErrorHandler`, `ErrorHandler`, `ApplicationError`, and severity model.
- Tests: existing Core error-handler coverage requires local verification.

## Specification 025 â€” Session Manager

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: in-memory session models, session-manager interface, and implementation.
- Files modified: Desktop composition root, session-manager specification, and decision log.
- Public APIs: `IProcessingSessionManager`, `ProcessingSessionManager`, session status/snapshot/result models.
- Autonomous decision: sessions are process-lifetime only and unexpected failures remain represented as terminal safe snapshots.
- Tests: pending local implementation and verification; this is a static-review risk.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 024 â€” Scan Orchestrator

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: Application project, processing models, orchestrator interface/implementation, and deterministic orchestration tests.

- Public APIs: `AboutViewModel`, static metadata, vetted URI properties, and external-link request event.
- Tests: metadata presentation and non-launching repository/documentation request events.
- Autonomous decision: external navigation is an event only; the host owns link opening.
- Expected test-count increase: 2 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 021 â€” Undo History

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: undo-session model, undo-history view model/view, and deterministic review tests.

- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 019 â€” Settings

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: settings draft, settings view model, settings view, and deterministic settings tests.
- Files modified: configuration service contract/implementation, configuration tests, shell view model/XAML, settings specification, and decision log.
- Public APIs: `IConfigurationService.SaveAsync(ApplicationSettings, CancellationToken)`, `SettingsDraft`, and `SettingsViewModel`.
- Tests: valid replacement persistence, UI save, invalid draft refusal, restore defaults, and discard behavior.
- Autonomous decision: UI exposes only implemented logging settings and marks saved changes restart-required.
- Expected test-count increase: 4 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 018 â€” Rule Editor

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.

- Expected test-count increase: 4 fact tests, unverified.
- Verification: blocked by prior sandbox NuGet signature networking and generated-file permissions.

## Specification 016 â€” Scan Progress

- Status: Implemented but not locally verified.
- Files created: scan-progress view, view model, stage model, and deterministic view-model tests.
- Public APIs: `ScanProgressViewModel`, `ScanProgressStage`, passive update methods, and cancellation event.
