# Implementation Specification Index

This index distinguishes historical foundation specifications from release-specific packages. Implemented code and the latest release proposal are authoritative when an older planning document describes a then-future boundary.

| Release | Status | Specification package |

| v0.9 Historical Snapshot Comparison | Complete / audited | [Release proposal](v0.9/00_v0.9_Release_Proposal.md), specifications 044-045, [audit corrections](v0.9/AUDIT_CORRECTIONS.md), and decisions |
| v0.9.1 Optional AI and Feature Controls | Implementation and corrective pass complete; manual GUI verification pending | [Release proposal](v0.9.1/00_v0.9.1_Release_Proposal.md), [specification 046](v0.9.1/046_Optional_AI_and_Advanced_Feature_Controls.md), [corrective specification 047](v0.9.1/047_Correction_Reliability_and_Usability_Pass.md), and [decisions](v0.9.1/IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS.md) |
| v1.0 Integrated Local Intelligence and Structure History | Final completion pass in progress on local `v1.0`; manual GUI/OCR verification pending | [Release proposal](v1.0/00_v1.0_Release_Proposal.md), [integrated specification 048](v1.0/048_v1.0_Integrated_Release.md), [final-completion specification 049](v1.0/049_Final_Product_Completion.md), and [decisions](v1.0/IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS.md) |

## Current boundary

v1.0 preserves the v0.9.1 local-first and suggestion-only AI boundary while adding bounded local OCR and metadata extraction, provenance-aware tags, deterministic Semantic Search Beta, and explicitly confirmed folder-restructuring history. Preview and diagram workflows are read-only. The only new file mutation is an independently confirmed, root-confined restructuring apply operation for disposable/user-approved content; it rejects overwrite, traversal, and missing-source conditions and records history only after success. No current specification authorizes autonomous AI filesystem control, monitoring, plugins, cloud indexing, or unreviewed execution.
