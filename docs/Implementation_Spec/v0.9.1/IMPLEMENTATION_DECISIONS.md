# v0.9.1 Implementation Decisions

## Save-driven active visibility

Dependent controls inside Settings react to the editable draft immediately. Shell navigation and Results actions update only after a successful explicit Save, matching the established persistence workflow and avoiding unsaved draft state changing the rest of the application.

## Conservative feature classification

Scanning, Results, duplicates, catalog browsing/search, saved searches, tags, rules, Settings, About, and safety feedback remain regular. Historical comparison, detailed diagnostics, and operation-history internals are advanced because they are specialist review/troubleshooting surfaces rather than primary workflows.

## Two supported AI capabilities

The earlier mixed file-organization response is narrowed to file rename only. Tags, category, and destination values are not requested from AI in v0.9.1. Deterministic tagging/classification and existing user-managed tags remain non-AI workflows. Folder structure remains a separate hierarchy-and-assignment proposal.

## Unknown JSON properties

Unknown properties are ignored for forward compatibility. Required properties, task/status values, identities, counts, graphs, confidence, and all filename/path safety rules remain strict. Markdown-fenced output is rejected because the provider was explicitly instructed to return JSON only.

## Reject-whole-response policy

No partially valid suggestion is published. A duplicate, invented identity, invalid folder graph, unsafe name, or other issue rejects the complete response so no ambiguous subset can reach the review workflow.

## No provider preflight for generation

Generation does not add a separate availability request. The explicit user request goes directly through the bounded provider call after local gates; this avoids unnecessary communication and lets Ollama return a typed missing-model or unsupported-response failure. Connection tests/model discovery remain explicit advanced actions.

## Review decisions are not execution

Accept and edit actions validate again and record a local decision where supported. They do not invoke `File`, `Directory`, action executor, rules executor, or undo APIs. Automatic filesystem changes remain outside v0.9.1 and require a separately specified mature preview/confirmation workflow.

## v1.0 boundary

Plugins, full localization, packaging overhaul, multi-provider architecture, content understanding, semantic indexes, background agents, automatic batch actions, and broad release engineering remain deferred.
