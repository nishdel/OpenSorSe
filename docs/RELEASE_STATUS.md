## Current product boundary

OpenSorSe 1.0 is a safe, local-first desktop application for understanding and organizing explicitly selected folders. AI and Advanced mode are independent and disabled by default. OCR and Semantic Search Beta are also separate local opt-ins and never activate AI.

The current Desktop workflow does not:

- Let AI rename, move, delete, overwrite, create, or otherwise modify source files. Optional Ollama can generate only capability-specific validated rename, logical folder-structure, or bounded document-text interpretation previews; document text requires a separate opt-in and explicit one-file request.
- Expose the historical generic Executor through the Desktop, execute rules, delete duplicates, write document metadata/tags, or run autonomous organization.
- Contact Ollama when AI is disabled or merely because the global AI switch is enabled. Provider requests additionally require an enabled capability, valid context, endpoint, and model.
- Treat catalog or structure comparison as certainty. Stored snapshots and semantic similarities are bounded review aids, not live filesystem truth.

Scanning, duplicate review, extraction, OCR, tagging, indexing/search, comparison, diagrams, and AI suggestions are non-mutating. The one source-location mutation is a deterministic restructuring plan that is previewed and separately confirmed against an exact preview identity. It is bounded to 500 moves under one approved root, revalidates the root before work, rejects traversal/reparse/missing/conflicting/overwrite conditions, never deletes, and records or rolls back outcomes. AI output cannot enter this service.

Duplicate View may, only after an explicit user command, pass a validated current-scan path to the operating-system shell. Each action is capped at five targets, uses no constructed shell command, reports partial failures, and performs no OpenSorSe filesystem mutation.

OpenSorSe-owned bounded JSON stores may retain settings, logs, AI review decisions, optional catalog snapshots/tags, saved queries, extracted native/OCR text, deterministic semantic vectors, and structure history under local application data. Current persistence, mutation, and network boundaries are detailed in [Safety and Privacy](SAFETY_AND_PRIVACY.md).

## Validation baseline

The exact standard in-place restore completed successfully. Current-source Debug and Release builds both succeeded with zero warnings and zero errors. The full suite passed 553 tests with none skipped in each configuration: Core 27, Scanner 56, Rules 68, Executor 36, Application 224, and Desktop 142. The suite includes generated real-PDF PDFium rendering, page-level OCR/failure/cleanup fakes, AI provider-boundary checks, live diagnostic privacy/retention/payload/schema/validation checks, selected-file AI context, cancellation/failure/retry recovery, exact model switching, settings/cache migration, resizable Files layout/branding contracts, consolidated navigation, progressive filters, and the FOSS inventory. Both builds compiled every Avalonia view, and Desktop composition tests validated the production dependency graph and gated navigation.

The Windows x64 self-contained publish succeeded and produced `OpenSorSe.exe` with file version `1.0.0.0`, product version `1.0.0`, the official associated icon, and a runtime declaration that includes .NET 8.0.28. The executable launched from the release directory, presented a responsive `OpenSorSe` window, and closed normally. Package contents and checksum were inspected. Full scanning/OCR/Ollama/Meaning Search/Saved scans workflow verification remains part of the manual release hold.

Tesseract is not installed or discoverable in this development environment, so live recognition was not claimed. Automated tests cover version/language detection, argument construction, cancellation, timeout, empty/oversized output, missing languages, mixed-page coordination, cleanup, and provider isolation through fakes. The PDF renderer itself was exercised in process against a generated real PDF.

## Documentation status

The architecture directory contains both current implementation documentation and longer-term design material. The 1.0 overview documents identify the delivered bounded content, OCR, semantic, AI, JSON-store, GUI, structure-history, and Windows portable-distribution components. Rich media/archive readers, relational database architecture, reports, plugins, broad localization, cloud indexing, signed installers, and automated publishing remain design material unless a release specification explicitly marks them implemented.

## Current release

OpenSorSe 1.0 implementation, automated validation, public README preparation, and local portable-package creation are complete on the local `v1.0` branch; inherited v0.9.1 and v1.0 GUI/OCR/platform verification remain required before considering integration or remote release publication. See the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), [implementation-specification index](Implementation_Spec/README.md), and [manual checklist](MANUAL_TESTING_v1.0.md). Do not merge into `main` until manual v0.9.1 and v1.0 verification is complete.
