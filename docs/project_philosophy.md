# Purpose

The Project Philosophy describes the values that guide the design, development, and evolution of OpenSorSe.

Its purpose is to provide a shared foundation for contributors, maintainers, and users when making architectural, technical, and product decisions.

When multiple solutions are technically valid, these principles should help determine which direction best aligns with the project's vision.

## Current Release Boundary

OpenSorSe 1.0 is a local-first, non-destructive-by-default analysis and organization application. AI and Advanced interface features remain independently disabled by default. AI is constrained to metadata-only rename and logical-folder proposals, is strictly validated, and remains suggestion-only. OCR Beta, metadata extraction, provenance tags, and Semantic Search Beta run locally and do not require AI.

Scanning, extraction, indexing, comparisons, diagrams, duplicates, and AI never modify selected files. The sole new mutation boundary is a deterministic folder-restructuring plan that the user previews and confirms separately. It validates an unchanged explicit root, moves only the reviewed relative paths, rejects overwrite/traversal/conflicts, and records its outcome. Preview, failure, cancellation, and partial results never activate repeat protection.

OpenSorSe 1.0 does not implement plugins, broad localization, packaged cross-platform releases, cloud indexing, live monitoring, report export, autonomous AI file control, or generic rule execution. References below to broader automation remain future direction.

# Vision

OpenSorSe exists to help people better understand, organize, discover, and automate their digital knowledge.

The project is built on the belief that Artificial Intelligence should enhance human decision-making rather than replace it.

Users should remain informed, empowered, and in control of their information.

---

# Core Principles

## User First

Every significant design decision should improve the user's experience, understanding, or control.

Technology exists to serve users—not the other way around.

---

## Privacy by Design

Whenever practical, user information should remain under the user's control.

Local processing should be preferred where it provides a meaningful benefit.

Cloud services should be optional rather than mandatory.

---

## Transparency

Users should understand what the application is doing.

AI-generated information, automation, and recommendations should be explainable whenever practical.

The application should avoid becoming an opaque "black box."

---

## Human in Control

Automation should assist rather than dictate.

Recommendations should be reviewable.

Users should always retain the ability to approve, modify, or reject significant actions.

---

## Simplicity

Complexity should only be introduced when it provides clear value.

The architecture should favor small, focused, understandable components over unnecessary abstraction.

---

## Modularity

The application should consist of well-defined subsystems with clear responsibilities.

Components should communicate through stable interfaces and remain independently maintainable.

---

## Extensibility

The architecture should encourage future growth.

New capabilities should be added through well-defined extension points rather than invasive modifications to the core.

---

## Reliability

Users should be able to trust the application with their data.

Failures should be isolated, recoverable where practical, and never compromise data integrity.

---

## Documentation

Documentation is considered part of the product.

Architectural knowledge should be preserved, maintained, and shared alongside the implementation.

---

## Community

OpenSorSe is intended to grow through collaboration.

Contributors should be welcomed, respected, and encouraged to improve the project through thoughtful discussion and constructive feedback.

---

# Decision Framework

When evaluating a proposed feature or architectural change, contributors should consider:

* Does it benefit users?
* Does it respect user privacy?
* Does it preserve architectural consistency?
* Does it keep the project maintainable?
* Does it improve extensibility?
* Does it align with the long-term vision?

If the answer to most of these questions is "yes," the proposal is likely aligned with the project's philosophy.

---

# Long-Term Goal

The long-term goal of OpenSorSe is not simply to organize files.

It is to build a trustworthy, extensible, and intelligent knowledge platform that helps people make better use of the information they already own.

The project should evolve carefully while preserving the principles that define its identity.

---

# Closing Statement

OpenSorSe is built on a simple belief:

Technology should reduce complexity, not create it.

Artificial Intelligence should increase understanding, not obscure it.

Software should empower people, not replace them.

Every contribution should move the project one step closer to that vision.
